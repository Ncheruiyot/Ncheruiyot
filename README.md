I am Nicholas Kiprotich Cheruiyot, a Kenyan by citizenship, born on August 18, 2001. My journey in life has been shaped by a deep sense of motivation and responsibility, traits that I bring to every endeavor I undertake.

In the realm of education, I am on the cusp of graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Chuka University, with an expected completion date in April 2023. This academic pursuit has equipped me with a strong foundation in computer science, laying the groundwork for my career.

My professional journey began at Gedeon’s Cyber, where I worked as a Computer Packages Trainer from December 2018 to August 2019. During this time, I not only taught computer packages effectively but also honed my communication skills and learned the importance of teamwork. Time management and effective interpersonal relations became second nature to me.

In early 2022, I had the privilege of serving as an IT Attaché at Fidelity Shield Insurance Company in Nairobi, Kenya. Here, I contributed by assisting in hardware and software system installations, conducting routine maintenance, and providing valuable technical support to users. Managing systems like Windows Server and handling office 365-related issues were part of my responsibilities. This experience strengthened my problem-solving and analytical skills and broadened my knowledge of network administration and security protocols.

My skill set is diverse, including proficiency in programming languages like PHP, Java, JavaScript, and SQL. I have experience in database management with MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server, and I'm well-versed in operating systems such as Windows and Linux. My knowledge extends to network administration, specifically with Cisco systems.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I am passionate about staying updated with the latest developments in the IT industry, continuously learning new programming languages and technologies, and pursuing certifications in ICT-related fields.

In my leisure time, I find joy in traveling, socializing, and networking with people from diverse backgrounds. Additionally, I dedicate myself to choir training, a creative outlet that allows me to express myself musically.
